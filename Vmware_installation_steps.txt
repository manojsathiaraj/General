Install GCC & libaio1/libaio

If secureboot is on kernel modules like vmmon and vmnet can be used only with digitally signed trusted certificate.

This problem essentially happens because of secure boot which does not allow kernel modules to load without being digitally signed with a trusted certificate. So we need to create a trusted key and use it to sign the newly compiled modules vmmon and vmnet.

These instructions have been tested for VMWare 15 and Ubuntu 18.04 up to 19.04.

    Install VMWare

    Run this

    sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all

    You'll see that there are issues with monitor and net, thas ok.

    Generate a key

    openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout VMWARE15.priv -outform DER -out VMWARE15.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=VMWARE/"

    You'll see info that it did it ok.

    Use this key we just generated to sign the two kernel modules.

    sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./VMWARE15.priv ./VMWARE15.der $(modinfo -n vmmon)
    sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./VMWARE15.priv ./VMWARE15.der $(modinfo -n vmnet)

    This does not give any feedback

    Check that signatures are applied correctly.

    tail $(modinfo -n vmmon) | grep "Module signature appended"

    You should get Binary file (standard input) matches

    Now we make this key trusted by importing it to machine owner key (MOK) management system with the command below. Here you can read more about MOKâ€™s job in Linux.

    sudo mokutil --import VMWARE15.der

    This will ask you for a password, enter some new password a bit long like 1515vmware. Reenter same password.

    Reboot, When reboot you should be presented with a menu with blue screen background, you have to make your way to enroll the key and enter the password you just created, this happens only once, then continue to boot.

    To test the driver / module installed correctly enter the command

    mokutil --test-key VMWARE15.der

    You should get VMWARE15.der is already enrolled and that means VMWare should be working.
